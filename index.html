                  <p class="boxp1">I have been many things: an EMT, a server, a sales representative, and arguably a pseudo-therapist to friends, acquaintances, and strangers.  But, seriously, I have had a wide array of experiences from these different jobs that range from patient care and strict adherence to protocols, to customer service, team-building and active listening.  One interesting fact about me is I lived on a yoga ashram for a month.  It changed my perception of how I should be <em>thinking, working,</em> and <em>living</em>; to work and live without expectations, but for the sake of the experience.

          I chose to take an <span style=color:red>intensive course on programming</span> after I finished a course on computers at Atlantic Cape Community College.  I have always loved computers, but never had the opportunity to take a class to discover and unlock this latent passion.  Any time I can delve deeply into understanding the structure of how something works, I find satisfaction.  After taking that class I decided I would begin a programmming/coding bootcamp at <strong>Epicodus</strong> before I start my bachelor's degree in computer science.
